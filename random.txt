Greetings,

After going through the Bakken&Baeck website I got a feeling that the company is open to working with a lot of diverse projects.  I am purely a technical person driven by the possibilities of real world Deep Learning and Machine Learning applications. I would love to build data solutions across projects and not get tied down to a single industry.  Bakken&Baeck comes across like a company where I would get the opportunity to identify ML and DL use cases without being tied down to a single industry. 

Cheers and Regards,
Arun Padmanabhan
